# MovieTag Summarizer

In this project, each movie is associated with multiple user-generated tags. The objective is to develop a SAS macro program that takes a specific movie as input and generates a concise list of keywords. These keywords serve as a summary of the diverse tags attributed to the chosen movie, providing valuable insights into its content and user-generated metadata.
